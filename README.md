# Algorithmic Dissection of Optic Flow Memory in Larval Zebrafish
This respository will host the code (jupyter notebooks) to analyze the data for / recreate the figures presented in Tanaka & Portugues (2025) Algorithmic dissection of optic flow memory in larval zebrafish [(preprint)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.15.648832v1.abstract).

## Dataset
The dataset to be analyzed by this repository will be uploaded to Zenodo (doi: 10.5281/zenodo.16085585) (in preparation).
